                My main hobby is meteorology. I’ve always been fascinated by the
                weather and love tracking storms, understanding weather
                patterns, and learning about the science behind meteorological
                phenomena. It's a hobby that keeps me curious and constantly
                learning, and I hope to employ machine learning techniques to
                side projects in the future.

                friends, soccer helps me stay active and sharp both physically
                and mentally. It’s a passion that balances my tech-focused life
                with some much-needed outdoor activity.
